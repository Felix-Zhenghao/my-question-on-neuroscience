- Why most creatures are symmetric wrt to the medial-lateral axes? Is there any isymmetric creature?

- "A natural assumption is that a coherent concept comprising many details must exist in a single place in the brain; however, an equally valid assumption is that a unified concept like “apple” exists in the mind in the form of multiple links between a variety of neural structures, each with a particular kind of information, coordinated through the action of memory retrieval." Then attention mechanism in the abstract latent space should be explored in AI.

- "Nerve cells do not connect randomly with one another in the formation of networks but make specific connections—at particular contact points—with certain postsynaptic target cells and not with others." How does the nerve cells 'know' where to connect with? There should be some guiding chemical stuff, then when and why the chemical stuff is released and 'grasped' by other nerve cells.

- How the nerve cells aggregate information? Is the aggregation process different between cell body and dendrite?

- Why there are beating neurons and bursting neurons? "By establishing periods of silence in otherwise ongoing activity, inhibition can produce a complex pattern of alternating firing and silence where none existed." Pretty interesting.
